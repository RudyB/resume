# My Resume

## How to Create a PDF of my Resume
First you are going to need to download and install the following dependencies:
* [PHP 7](http://php.net/downloads.php) 
* [Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
* [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)

Once you have downloaded and installed the dependencies listed above, you will be good to go. 
From there you just need to open up a terminal and enter:
```bash
$ make
```
If you already have the dependencies installed you can simply enter:
```bash
$ make pdf
```

## Want to make your own resume?
Fork my project, Download the dependencies, & Just follow the format of my [resume.md](resume.md)

## Too lazy to generate it?
[Here](https://github.com/RudyB/resume/releases/latest) is a PDF of my latest resume. I keep a them all as releases.
